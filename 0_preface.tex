\chapter*{Preface}

The purpose of this is for you to state explicitly the extent to which your dissertation relies on the work of others, and highlight the portion that you claim to be your own original work.  For example: you might say: “The results of chapter 3 rely upon a simulation provided by the research group.  The analysis of the data is entirely my own work.  I carried out the analytical calculation of chapter 4 in conjunction with my supervisor…” and so on. Without this statement, it will be assumed that no work is original and that your thesis is a review article.  If you merely claim that the thesis is all your own work, you should be aware that any evidence to the contrary may leave you susceptible to charges of plagiarism.
